# Install Ubuntu 22.04 Server with AtomCMS / Arcturus / Nitro Client and Imager
Download link : https://ubuntu.com/download/server for Ubuntu 22.04 **jammy**

### In this tutorial we will be using an Ubuntu server 22.04 with NGINX.  
- We will setup the emulator as a service, therefore no action is required after an reboot.

So, in the end, this will:

* Lower on hardware usage, also saving server costs.
* Lower on server costs, due to the fact no Windows license is required.
* Greater website perfomance in comparison to IIS, Apache and others.

When starting from scratch, this would be the recomended order :
1. VPS Setup
2. Atom Setup  
3. Imager and Gamedata setup  
4. Cloudflare and SSL setup  
5. Emulator setup  
6. Nitro and settings setup

#### The only action you need to do is get a full pack of the c_images
